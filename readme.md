# A discussion about motions types

Motions can come in three main flavors (called "classes"):

1. ***Main motion***. The main motion is the measure to be voted on (e.g., Bill 20-1111).
2. ***Subsidiary motions***.
3. ***Incidental motions***.

There are also ***privileged motions*** (such as to adjourn or recess), but I do not record them.
